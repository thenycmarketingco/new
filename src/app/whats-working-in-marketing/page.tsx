        <p>
          <a href="https://www.moodap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-teal-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-teal-700">Moodap&trade;</a> just launched with 25,000 pages. Not 25. Not 250. Twenty-five thousand. And within 2 months, over 2,000 of those pages hit page 1 on Google. Traffic went from zero to 1,000+ monthly visits. Growth: 3,490%.
        </p>
        <p>
          How? Programmatic SEO at scale. Every page is unique, keyword-targeted, and built to match real search intent. No AI-generated filler. No duplicate content with swapped city names. Every page has a reason to exist and a keyword it&apos;s built to rank for.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tech stack made this possible. Try deploying 25,000 pages on WordPress — it would crawl. On our <strong>Next.js + Vercel</strong> stack, every page loads in under 2 seconds, gets server-rendered for SEO, and deploys globally on edge servers. Google indexed thousands of pages in the first week because the site was fast, clean, and structured correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moodap is pre-revenue — this is pure organic growth with zero ad spend. The foundation is set. When monetization kicks in, the traffic is already there.

    title: "Micro Sites with Exact Match Domains Are Killing It",
    content: (
      <>
        <p>
          We&apos;ve been testing micro sites on exact match domains (EMDs) and the results are insane. Page 1 rankings in 7 days. Not 7 months. Seven days.
        </p>
        <p>
          The strategy: buy an exact match domain for a hyper-specific keyword — like <a href="https://www.thenycseo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-teal-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-teal-700">thenycseo.com</a>, <a href="https://www.thenycmobilesalon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-teal-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-teal-700">thenycmobilesalon.com</a>, or <a href="https://www.thenycmaid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-teal-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-teal-700">thenycmaid.com</a>. Build a fast, focused site on our stack. Publish 10-20 highly targeted pages. Submit to Google. Watch it index and rank within the first week.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google supposedly &ldquo;devalued&rdquo; EMDs years ago. That&apos;s not what we&apos;re seeing. When you combine an exact match domain with a lightning-fast site, strong on-page SEO, and content that actually matches search intent — EMDs still have a massive edge. The domain itself signals relevance before Google even crawls the first page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Results from our latest micro sites:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The NYC SEO</strong> — 500 page 1 rankings in 15 days</li>
          <li><strong>The NYC Mobile Salon</strong> — 500 page 1 rankings in under 15 days</li>
          <li><strong>The NYC Classifieds</strong> — 10+ page 1 rankings in under 10 days</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We&apos;re now building micro sites as part of our <Link href="/nyc-marketing-company-services-list" className="text-teal-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-teal-700">SEO strategy</Link> for clients in competitive industries. Instead of fighting for one domain to rank for everything, we deploy targeted micro sites that dominate specific niches fast — then funnel the leads back to the main business.

    content: (
      <>
        <p>
          We just launched Selena — a fully custom AI-powered text bot built for sales and customer service. She handles inbound inquiries, qualifies leads, answers questions, books appointments, and follows up automatically via SMS. All in a natural, conversational tone that doesn&apos;t feel like a bot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Selena runs on our own infrastructure — <strong>Telnyx</strong> for SMS, <strong>Supabase</strong> for conversation history and lead tracking, and <strong>Claude AI</strong> for natural language understanding. She&apos;s not a chatbot widget on a website. She&apos;s a real phone number that texts back like a human, 24/7.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early results: response times went from hours to seconds. Lead-to-appointment conversion jumped 40%. And business owners stopped losing after-hours leads to competitors who picked up the phone first.
        </p>
        <p>
          Selena is the first product from our new platform, <a href="https://www.fullloopcrm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-teal-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-teal-700">Full Loop CRM</a>. More on that below.

It&apos;s our own CRM platform built specifically for small businesses that are tired of paying $300/month for tools they use 10% of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Full Loop combines lead tracking, automated follow-up, AI-powered text bots (like Selena), appointment scheduling, review management, and reporting — all in one platform. Built on the same stack we use for everything: <strong>Next.js</strong>, <strong>Supabase</strong>, <strong>Resend</strong>, and <strong>Telnyx</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn&apos;t a white-labeled version of someone else&apos;s software. We built it from scratch because every CRM we tried was either too bloated, too expensive, or missing the <Link href="/artificial-intelligence-marketing-services-offered" className="text-teal-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-teal-700">AI automation</Link> features our clients actually need. Now our clients get it bundled into their <Link href="/nyc-marketing-pricing-guide" className="text-teal-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-teal-700">marketing packages</Link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Full loop: marketing drives the lead, AI qualifies and books it, CRM tracks it, automation follows up, review system closes the loop. That&apos;s why it&apos;s called Full Loop.

    title: "We Abandoned All CMS Platforms. Here's Why.",
    content: (
      <>
        <p>
          As of this week, The NYC Marketing Company has fully abandoned WordPress, Webflow, Squarespace, and every other CMS platform. Every client site — including this one — now runs on our custom stack:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Next.js</strong> — React framework for server-rendered, SEO-optimized pages</li>
          <li><strong>Vercel</strong> — Edge hosting with global CDN, instant deploys</li>
          <li><strong>Supabase</strong> — Postgres database, auth, real-time subscriptions</li>
          <li><strong>Resend</strong> — Transactional email that actually lands in inboxes</li>
          <li><strong>Telnyx</strong> — Programmable voice, SMS, and communication APIs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Why? Because CMS platforms are bloated, slow, and full of security vulnerabilities. WordPress sites average 3-5 second load times. Ours load in under 2 seconds. WordPress sites get hacked constantly — ours don&apos;t have a database exposed to the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result: every site we build scores 90+ on Core Web Vitals, deploys in seconds, and costs less to host than a WordPress site with 12 plugins. This is the same tech stack Fortune 500 companies use — and we bring it to local businesses at <Link href="/nyc-marketing-pricing-guide" className="text-teal-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-teal-700">small business pricing</Link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your current marketing company is still building on WordPress in 2026, ask them why.

    content: (
      <>
        <p>
          Google rolled out another core update this month. Here&apos;s what we&apos;re seeing across our client portfolio:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sites with original, experience-based content are gaining. Rewritten AI slop is getting crushed.</li>
          <li>Page speed matters more than ever. Clients on our custom stack saw zero negative impact. Clients we audited on WordPress lost 10-20% traffic.</li>
          <li>Local signals are getting stronger. <Link href="/nyc-marketing-company-services-list" className="text-teal-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-teal-700">Google Business Profile</Link> activity, review velocity, and local citations are carrying more weight in map pack rankings.</li>
          <li>Internal linking is being rewarded. Sites with strong topical clusters and cross-linked service/industry/area pages are outperforming flat site structures.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our takeaway: keep doing what works. Build real content from real experience. Make your site fast. Link everything together. The fundamentals haven&apos;t changed — Google is just getting better at enforcing them.

        </p>
        <p>
          Why? Because people don&apos;t want to fill out a form and wait. They want to ask a question and get an answer.

Not generic &ldquo;we serve restaurants&rdquo; pages — deep, long-tail pages like <Link href="/industries-we-offer-marketing-services-for/personal-injury-law-firm-marketing" className="text-teal-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-teal-700">personal injury law firm marketing</Link> and <Link href="/industries-we-offer-marketing-services-for/hvac-company-marketing" className="text-teal-600 underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-teal-700">HVAC company marketing</Link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within 2 weeks, we&apos;re already seeing indexation and early ranking signals for dozens of these pages.
